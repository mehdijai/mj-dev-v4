# About the project
3SP (Save, Safe, Share Passwords) is a free desktop application where you can encrypt and store your private keys or password.
[Official website](https://3sp.medostudios.com)

## How it works
The data you enter are encrypted and saved, it’s only decrypted when it is displayed on your screen. The app does not perform any network connection, it works on offline mode. With that being said, no data are sent to a third party. The data are kept inside the application.

## Backup & Share keys
You can export all your keys on a (.3sp) file, And import it again. This way you can import your keys on another device you own or share some keys with others (common keys with a team for example). However, you must log in with the same password you used to export the keys, otherwise, the file won’t be imported.

# Features

## Secure
3SP’s main task is to secure your keys. Therefore, your keys are encrypted in an end-to-end method, to insure you are the only one to access them within the app.

## Simple
We have built this app to make it very easy and simple to use. The design is simple, clean, and easy to navigate.

## Multi-users
The power of 3SP is the sharable key. You can share the keys created with another user or laptop. And the exported keys will be safe and encrypted.
