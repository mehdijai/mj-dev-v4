        Iâ€™m a curious, autonomous developer. I started my journey in 2019
        professionally. The beginning was with building my two majors SaaS;
        Tabarro3.ma, Autodrive.ma. I have a long experience with
        JavaScript/TypeScript, SCSS/SASS, NodeJS, and PHP Laravel, VueJS. Plus,
        ElectronJS, Figma, and other tools, programming languages, and skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my carrer, I worked startups and was responsible for developing,
        creating, maintaining and deploying Web Applications. This experience
        led me to acquiring good skill set in tech, from technical skills at
        languages and frameworks, infrastructure and handling production
        projects, to soft skills as team player, leading projects, critical
        thinking, and solution-driven mentality
